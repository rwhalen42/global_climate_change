### Changes in Modern Temperatures

#Changed the names of the the year and temperature columns to `year` and `annual_temp`
#The units of temperature are Celcius but are provided as the difference from the ean temperature between 1951-1980

#### Changes in Modern Temperatures (Post 1950)
```{r}

### Hypothesis 
**Question 11:** How do current (i.e., since 1950) changes in 
atmospheric CO2 concentration and average global temperature compare to 
pre-historic (i.e., in the past hundreds of thousands of years) changes in these
variables?

**Answer 11:**
Current changes in atmospheric CO2 and temperature are increasing at a steady rate while the CO2 atmospheric concentration and temperature changes in the pre-historic era fluctuated greatly and weren't steadily increasing
**Question 12:** What does this suggest about whether recent changes in 
temperature are due to natural or anthropogenic (human) factors? 

**Answer 12:**
This highly suggests that the recent changes in temperature are due to anthropogenic factors
**Question 13:** Is plausible that recent increase in atmospheric carbon 
dioxide is a result of natural fluctuations and not human-induced?

**Answer 13:**
It could be natural fluctuations but it likely isn't. The CO2 naturally flucated in pre-historic times but never really went above 300ppmv of CO2 while in todays world we have over 400ppmv of atmospheric CO2
